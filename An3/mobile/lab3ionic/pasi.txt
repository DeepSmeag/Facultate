		how to send photo? as base64 encoded? send that and file name? send just the file name and rely on the client to load it based on the name??
		requirement only says upload, not necessarily the photo as I understand it
- Fisiere XXXXXXXXXXX
	be able to save photo to device and on server

- Maps XXXXXXXXXXX
	using the ionic library, the react one doesn't work at first glance so why bother
	create new info about object - long, lat; this is what I save to the server;
	click on map to pinpoint location, save that location for future reference (both points are here, being able to pin and save that pin)
	the long and lat attributes are changed when I click on the map, so that's what I save with the object
- Animatii XXXXXXXXX
	animate something with your own animation
	override default animation for some components (ex: button for save)
